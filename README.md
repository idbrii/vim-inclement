=============

*Implement import statements from tags with inclement.*

vim-inclement provides a mapping to add an import (include/require/...) for the
symbol under the cursor based on your tags file.

Use `<Leader>hi` to insert an import.

vim-inclement will detect if you've already imported the file.

There are some configuration options for how and where to insert your imports.
