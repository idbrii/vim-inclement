Introduction~

vim-inclement provides a mapping to add an import (include/require/...) for the
symbol under the cursor based on your tags file.

Use `<Leader>hi` to insert an import.

vim-inclement will detect if you've already imported the file.

There are some configuration options for how and where to insert your imports.
See the top of inclement.vim.

						  *inclement-configuration*
Configuration~

g:inclement_use_preview                           *g:inclement_use_preview*
        Default: 0
        Open the preview window to show the new include.

g:inclement_n_dir_to_trim                         *g:inclement_n_dir_to_trim*
        Default: 0
        Trim this many directories from the tag path for the include. If you
        often have the same number of paths leading up to your include
        directory, this can be useful to clean it up.

g:inclement_max_element_in_path                   *g:inclement_max_element_in_path*
        Default: 0
        Limit the number of directories/files in the include path. If your
        includes only use a single token, then set this to 1.

g:inclement_after_first_include                   *g:inclement_after_first_include*
        Default: 0
        Place the include after the first include in the file. Otherwise it's
        after the last include.

g:inclement_include_directories                   *g:inclement_include_directories*
        Default: ''
        A |bar|-separated list of directories to strip from the include path.
        Using `let g:inclement_include_directories = "lib|src"` will convert
        `~/project/src/lib/gamera/init.lua` into `gamera/init.lua`

g:inclement_src_root                              *g:inclement_src_root*
        Default: ''
        When you setup your project, set this to the root of your source
        folder so we can strip this path from any includes.
